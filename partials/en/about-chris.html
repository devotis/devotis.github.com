            <p>
              I wrote my first programs in Basic on the

                Commodore 64
              </a>.
              A TV show called Qwerty from the late 80s was going to do a broadcast on the use of computers in elementary school in the 80s.
              The film crew arrived at my elementary school the

              and captured some of my early programming skills on film. There's me at 3:12 min on the right next to my brother.
              It's in dutch but there's me saying at the very end that "Later, there wil be computers everywhere".

            <h4>Applied physics</h4>
            <p>
              At the age of 17th I started my study Applied Physics at the THRijswijk. Nature and technology have always had my interest.
              I learned about relativity, water flowing, thermodynamics, mathematics, robotics and ... programming.
              Programming we needed as a way to process signals from sensors and steer what needed to be steered.
              I got my master's degree in Applied Physics in four years.

            <h4>ICT-Consultancy</h4>
            <p>
              I was just 21 and found myself to young to commence with nine-to-five working days.
              I decided to do a Post-graduate program on ICT Consultancy for 1 year.
              I learned about object-oriented programming, structured analysis, website development, javascript,
              databases, telematics, ITIL and Prince2.

              Pink Elephant was my first employer. That company co-founded the ICT Consultancy program.
              Through secondment I gained experience working for different companies.
              I grew to the level of 3rd line system administrator within eighteen months.
              The team and I solved problems with systems that no one else could solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Managing systems didn't inspire me much, because you don't really get to create anything.
              I like building nice and strong things that people like to see or use.
              Programming is a way that allows you to do just that.

              In Februari 2002 I changed jobs and started working for Leads to Loyals, at which time was called PlantijnCasparie DM.
              At the time they managed multiple marketing databases, all with a different data model.
              The customers had now way to access them over the internet.
              I was given the assignment to create a way for the customers to access their database over the internet through a webapplication
            </p>
            <p>
              A single web application powered by a meta-data model describing the databases turned out to be the best way.
              By the end of the year all our customers had access to the brand new web application called myBase.
            </p>
            <p>
              At PCDM I remained active as a consultant, architect and programmer of multi-channel marketing communication platforms.
              I worked together with project managers, business analysts and marketeers.
              Doing so contributed in meeting goals set for the platforms.

              By analysing business requirements and translating those to both functional and technical requirements,
              I bridged the gap between project management and IT. It helped 2organize optimising their design phase of application development.
              Worked there for almost a year (2007/2008).

              Leads to Loyals was looking for a successor of the IT manager who had left.
              The challenge of being responsible for the systems running the many marketing platforms
              and being member of the management at the same time attracted me.
              Moreover, the organization is small enough to continue to program as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              For 2.5 years I worked on expanding our web services and optimising as well.
              But doing in a way that minimized the spectrum of techniques used.
              This allowed the rest of the IT team to onboard on web development better.
            </p>
            <p>
              All web services are now based on JavaScript both client-side and server-side.
              I introduced the Ext JS library that allowed rapid UI prototyping and web application development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I migrated our premises hosted office environment to a hosted desktop environment in the cloud.
              One and a half year later I further reduced IT costs per employee from ±80 euro to ±4 euro per employee per month by migrating to Google Apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I prepared moving our marketing platform by engaing Amazon Web Services
              that allowed us to further optimize availability and performance of the marketing platforms.
